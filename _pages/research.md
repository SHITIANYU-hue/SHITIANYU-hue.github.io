## Optimizing Control Performance based on Deep Neural Network 
*University of California Berkeley, June. 2018~ September. 2018*  
*Advisors*: [Dr. Ching-Yao Chan](https://path.berkeley.edu/ching-yao-chan) and [Dr. Pin Wang](https://path.berkeley.edu/pin-wang)  
* Proposed an end-to-end deep learning framework (spatial-temporal block) that aims at making multi-step collective prediction for different types of bus passenger flow (boarding and alighting) in a network-wide region level.
* Captured simultaneously both long-range spatial dependencies and the correlations with channel dimension and predicted the boarding demand and alighting demand at each region in the near future.

## A Pseudo-3D Convolutional Neural Network based Framework for Short-term Mixed Passenger Flow Prediction in Large-scale Public Transit 
*National University of Singapore, Apr. 2019~ Aug. 2019*  
*Advisors*: [Prof. Lee Der-Horng](http://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/cee/people/ceeleedh/) and [Prof. Jiangang Jin](http://naoce.sjtu.edu.cn/en/teachershow.aspx?info_lb=24&info_id=8&flag=2)  
*Co-worker*: Dr. Siyu Hao and De Zhao  
*  Proposed a Pseudo-3D Convolutional Neural Network (Pseudo-3DCNN) based model to predict the public transport passenger flow in a network-wide region level.
*  Took metro passenger flow, bus passenger flow as well as the transfer flow between metro system and bus system together into consideration instead of merely predicting a single type of passenger flow.
*  The feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed model has been demonstrated on real-world data collected in Singapore.
*  Paper presented in TRB 2020.

## [Understanding semantic similarity among subway stations using smart card data](https://zhuangdingyi.github.io/files/Final_report_prof_lee.pdf) 
*National University of Singapore, July. 2018~ Sept. 2018*  
*Advisors*: [Prof. Lee Der-Horng](https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/cee/staff/lee-der-horng/) and [Prof. Jiangang Jin](http://naoce.sjtu.edu.cn/en/teachershow.aspx?info_lb=24&info_id=8&flag=2)  
*Co-worker*: Dr. Siyu Hao  
  * Proposed a new conception to understand metropolitan mobility as words  
  * Independently selected mobility features then trained stacked autoencoder network to discover mobility semantics  
  * Applied topic modeling (TF-IDF+SVD+LDA) on scraped POI data to find service semantics 
  * Paper published in *Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technology*[doi](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2020.02.017)

## [Understanding the bike sharing travel demand and cycle lane network: the case of Shanghai](https://zhuangdingyi.github.io/files/2018-08-23-Pre-Bikesharing.pdf)  
*Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Mar. 2017~ June. 2018*  
*Advisor*: [Prof. Jiangang Jin](http://naoce.sjtu.edu.cn/en/teachershow.aspx?info_lb=24&info_id=8&flag=2)  
  * Proposed methods to scrape data from bike-sharing application  
  * Applied graphic clustering to mine the insight of bike-sharing data  
  * Suggested a method to explore cycle lane network then presented advice for urban planning  
  * Paper accepted published in *International Journal of Sustainable Transportation* [doi](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15568318.2019.1699209) .
