[[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL95dglox2c&t=158s)] [paper] [code]

*McGill University, Jan. 2020~ present*  
*Advisors*: [Prof. Lijun Sun](https://lijunsun.github.io/) 
*  Utilize the graph attention networks in the navigation setting of multi-agent reinforcement learning for mixed-autonomy cooperation.
*  Introduce Dynamic relational index based on both velocity and position information to capture attention features among surrounding agents.
*  Conduct extensive experiments in different difficult levels of transportation networks against different baselines to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach..

[[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHQaaQjuyI)] [[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.11212.pdf)] [[code](https://github.com/SHITIANYU-hue/Data-driven-control)]

*University of California Berkeley, June. 2018~ September. 2018*  
*Advisors*: [Dr. Ching-Yao Chan](https://path.berkeley.edu/ching-yao-chan) and [Dr. Pin Wang](https://path.berkeley.edu/pin-wang)  
* Proposed a new methodology which combine Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Time Delay Neural Network to evaluate automated vehicle control performance and model the behavior of low level controller.
* Designed an optimized feed-forward compensator based on deep neural network and achieved improved performance in U-turn scenario.

[video] [[paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8917392)] [code]

*University of California Berkeley, June. 2018~ September. 2018*  
*Advisors*: [Dr. Ching-Yao Chan](https://path.berkeley.edu/ching-yao-chan) and [Dr. Pin Wang](https://path.berkeley.edu/pin-wang)  
* Designed two similar Deep Q learning frameworks with quadratic approximator for deciding how to select a comfortable gap and follow the preceding vehicle. 
* Proposed a novel hierarchical deep reinforcement learning for decision making and control of lane change situations.
