[[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHQaaQjuyI)] [[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.11212.pdf)] [[code](https://github.com/SHITIANYU-hue/Data-driven-control)]

*University of California Berkeley, June. 2018~ September. 2018*  
*Advisors*: [Dr. Ching-Yao Chan](https://path.berkeley.edu/ching-yao-chan) and [Dr. Pin Wang](https://path.berkeley.edu/pin-wang)  
* Proposed a new methodology which combine Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Time DelayNeural Network to evaluate automated vehicle control performance and model the behavior of low levelcontroller.
* Designed an optimized feed-forward compensator based on deep neural network and achieved improvedperformance in U-turn scenario.

[[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL95dglox2c&t=158s)] [paper] [code]

*McGill University, Jan. 2020~ present*  
*Advisors*: [Prof. Lijun Sun](https://lijunsun.github.io/) 
*  Utilize the graphattention networks in the navigation setting of multi-agentreinforcement learning for mixed-autonomy cooperation.
*  Introduce Dynamic relational in-dex based on both velocity and position information to capture attention features among surrounding agents.
*  Conduct extensiveexperiments in different difficult levels of transportationnetworks against different baselines to demonstrate the ef-fectiveness of the proposed approach..
