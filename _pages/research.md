## Optimizing Control Performance based on Deep Neural Network 
[[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOHQaaQjuyI)] [[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.11212.pdf)] [[code](https://github.com/SHITIANYU-hue/Data-driven-control)]

*University of California Berkeley, June. 2018~ September. 2018*  
*Advisors*: [Dr. Ching-Yao Chan](https://path.berkeley.edu/ching-yao-chan) and [Dr. Pin Wang](https://path.berkeley.edu/pin-wang)  
* Proposed a new methodology which combine Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Time DelayNeural Network to evaluate automated vehicle control performance and model the behavior of low levelcontroller.
* Designed an optimized feed-forward compensator based on deep neural network and achieved improvedperformance in U-turn scenario.

## A Pseudo-3D Convolutional Neural Network based Framework for Short-term Mixed Passenger Flow Prediction in Large-scale Public Transit 
*National University of Singapore, Apr. 2019~ Aug. 2019*  
*Advisors*: [Prof. Lee Der-Horng](http://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/cee/people/ceeleedh/) and [Prof. Jiangang Jin](http://naoce.sjtu.edu.cn/en/teachershow.aspx?info_lb=24&info_id=8&flag=2)  
*Co-worker*: Dr. Siyu Hao and De Zhao  
*  Proposed a Pseudo-3D Convolutional Neural Network (Pseudo-3DCNN) based model to predict the public transport passenger flow in a network-wide region level.
*  Took metro passenger flow, bus passenger flow as well as the transfer flow between metro system and bus system together into consideration instead of merely predicting a single type of passenger flow.
*  The feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed model has been demonstrated on real-world data collected in Singapore.
*  Paper presented in TRB 2020.
