Lijun Sun is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics at McGill University. He obtained his PhD degree in Civil Engineering (Transportation) from National University of Singapore in 2015, and earned his Bachelor degree in Civil Engineering from Tsinghua University (Beijing, China) in 2011. During PhD, he worked at Mobility and Transport Planning module at the [Future Cities Laboratory](http://www.fcl.ethz.ch/), Singapore-ETH center. Prior to joining McGill, he was a Postdoctoral Associate at [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/). His current research centers on the area of urban computing and smart transportation, developing innovative methodologies and applications to address efficiency, resilience, and sustainability issues in urban transportation systems. In particular, he is interested in integrating advances in mobile sensing and machine learning into human mobility modeling, agent-based simulation, and intelligent transportation systems to explore how big data, artificial intelligence, and cyber-physical systems could benefit urban life and help build smart cities. His work has been featured in popular media outlets, including Wired, Citylab, Scientific American, and MIT Technology Review.
