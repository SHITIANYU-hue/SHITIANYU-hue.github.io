I am a first year PhD student in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) Engineering, Department of Civil Engineering, University of Toronto. My research is focuing on reinforcement learning for mixed autonomous traffic control.

I received my bachelor degree in vehicle engineering from [Beijing Institute of Technology](http://english.bit.edu.cn/). During my undergraduate study, I was a visiting student researcher at [Berkeley Deep Drive, University of California Berkeley](https://bdd-data.berkeley.edu/). After my undergraduate study, I worked as research intern in L4 automated driving group at [Momenta.ai](https://www.momenta.cn/en/). I also worked as research intern in based model group at [Megvii Technology](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yuB-cfoAAAAJ&hl=en). During my master study at McGill, I wored on Deep reinforcement learning for autonomous vehicle decision making. I also did an internship at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) on reinforcement learning for traffic signal control. 


## Research Interests

My current research centers on the area of reinforcement learning and deep neural network, developing innovative methodologies and applications to address safety, efficiency, and resilience issues in multi-agent systems decision and control.
